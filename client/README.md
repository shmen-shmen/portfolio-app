# FRONT END APPS

## RANDOM QUOTE MACHINE:

The app renders a random quote from the internet onto the screen.
Additional functionality includes the ability to choose a quote of a
specific category from the given list and to share it on social
networks.

The design of the app aims to reflect it's meaninglessness. The
interface is made to be counterintuitive, frustrating and struggling
to use. Elements scroll off the screen, blink and disappear to annoy
and distract the user. The main substance: the text of a quote – is
hidden from the user, and the main element is the exit button, which
invites user not to waste any more time here.

On the other hand, the visuals are made to be appealing for a
potential reader of quotes – pieces of text stripped out of any
context and meaning, lowered to the level of content. If i were to
try and sell this app, I would use words like "minimalist", and
"thought provoking" in order to imply a deeper meaning, although
there is obviously no meaning at all.

Enjoy!
