# FRONT END APPS

## RANDOM QUOTE MACHINE:

The app renders a random quote from the internet onto the screen. Additional functionality includes the ability to choose a quote of a specific category from the given list and to share it on social networks.

The design of the app aims to reflect it's meaninglessness. The interface is made to be counterintuitive, frustrating and struggling to use.Elements scroll off the screen, blink and disappear to annoy and distract the User. The main substance, the text of a quote – is hidden from the User, and the main element intead is the exit button, which suggests the User should not waste any more time here.

On the other hand, the visuals are made to be appealing for a potential reader of quotes – pieces of text stripped of any context and meaning, lowered to the level of content. If i were to try and sell this app, I would use words like "minimalist", and "thought provoking" in order to imply a deeper meaning, although there is obviously no meaning at all.

Enjoy!
